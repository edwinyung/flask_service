"""
A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Rather than registering views and other code directly with an application, they are registered with a blueprint. Then the blueprint is registered with the application when it is available in the factory function.

Flaskr will have two blueprints, one for authentication functions and one for the blog posts functions. The code for each blueprint will go in a separate module. Since the blog needs to know about authentication, you’ll write the authentication one first.

This creates a Blueprint named 'auth'. Like the application object, the blueprint needs to know where it’s defined, so __name__ is passed as the second argument. The url_prefix will be prepended to all the URLs associated with the blueprint.

Import and register the blueprint from the factory using app.register_blueprint(). Place the new code at the end of the factory function before returning the app.

There are a few differences from the register view:

The user is queried first and stored in a variable for later use.

check_password_hash() hashes the submitted password in the same way as the stored hash and securely compares them. If they match, the password is valid.

session is a dict that stores data across requests. When validation succeeds, the user’s id is stored in a new session. The data is stored in a cookie that is sent to the browser, and the browser then sends it back with subsequent requests. Flask securely signs the data so that it can’t be tampered with.

Now that the user’s id is stored in the session, it will be available on subsequent requests. At the beginning of each request, if a user is logged in their information should be loaded and made available to other views.

Creating, editing, and deleting blog posts will require a user to be logged in. A decorator can be used to check this for each view it’s applied to.

This decorator returns a new view function that wraps the original view it’s applied to. The new function checks if a user is loaded and redirects to the login page otherwise. If a user is loaded the original view is called and continues normally. You’ll use this decorator when writing the blog views.
